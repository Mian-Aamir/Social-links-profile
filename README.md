# Social Links Profile

This is a responsive **Social Links Profile Card** built using **HTML** and **CSS**. The project is inspired by a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to build a clean and centered profile card layout.
- Use of `:root` and CSS variables for theming and reusability.
- Responsive design using media queries and `max-width`.
- How to use `flexbox` for vertical alignment and spacing.
